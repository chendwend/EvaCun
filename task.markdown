# Task Objective

The goals of the translation task are:

- To investigate the applicability of current MT    techniques in Akkadian translation.
- To examine the significant challenges in Akkadian translation (e.g. word order and syntax problems).
- To build free corpora for machine translation and evaluation of Akkadian.
- To afford novice researchers the chance to gain experience in the field of machine translation.
- To further machine translation research for Akkadian and the exploration of forefront machine translation technology.

# Task Requirements
The participantsâ€™ task is to improve the models in terms of machine translation performance.  

The task containts two tracks, i.e. closed track and open track. To ensure the fairness of the competition, only the given training data and model are allowed to use in the closed track. However, when building the translation system in open track other models, resources and self-built modes are permitted. In this case, if any additional data or model is employed, participants should make it clear to us so that we can evaluate the performance of the models on our provided dataset separately from their performance on external data.
